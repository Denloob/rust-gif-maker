## About
This is a rewrite of a small C project in rust. For learning purposes.

The project focuses on language basics.

The program can add frames to a vector, move them, apply filters, etc, and in the end it can display all of them as a GIF.

## Running

Just cd into the directory and
```sh
cargo run
```
